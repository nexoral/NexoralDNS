## ⚠️ **IMPORTANT WARNING - LAN USE ONLY**

**🚨 DO NOT HOST THIS ON THE CLOUD OR PUBLIC INTERNET 🚨**

NexoralDNS is **STRICTLY** designed for **Local Area Network (LAN)** use only.

**Why you should NEVER use this on cloud/public hosting:**

- ⛔ **DNS Spoofing Detection:** Your ISP will detect this as DNS spoofing activity
- 🔒 **Automatic Blocking:** ISPs will automatically block your DNS server
- 🔀 **Traffic Redirection:** All DNS traffic will be forcibly routed to your ISP's DNS servers
- 💔 **Service Disruption:** Your service will become completely non-functional
- ⚖️ **Potential Legal Issues:** May violate ISP terms of service

**✅ Correct Usage:**
- Install on a local machine within your LAN (home/office network)
- Configure your local router to use this DNS server
- Use only for internal network traffic and custom domain resolution

**❌ Incorrect Usage:**
- Hosting on cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, DigitalOcean, etc.)
- Using as a public DNS resolver
- Exposing port 53 to the public internet

**This warning applies to all deployment scenarios. Always ensure NexoralDNS remains within your private network boundaries.**

- Track network activity patterns
- Identify bandwidth-heavy applications

### 🎛️ Centralized Control
- Manage DNS settings for your entire network from one interface
- Easy configuration without touching individual devices
- Backup and restore DNS configurations

---

## ✨ Key Features

- **🌐 Custom Domain Management:** Create internal domains without external DNS servers
- **📈 DNS Traffic Monitoring:** Comprehensive logging and real-time analytics
- **🐳 Easy Deployment:** One-command installation via Docker
- **🖥️ Web-based Management:** Intuitive dashboard accessible at `localhost:4000`
- **🛡️ Security Filtering:** Block unwanted domains and protect your network
- **👨‍💻 Developer-Friendly:** Perfect for development environments

---

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Install:** Run the installation command on any machine in your LAN
2. **Configure Router:** Set your router's DNS to point to the NexoralDNS machine
3. **Activate:** Use the web interface to activate with your cloud key
4. **Manage:** Create custom domains and monitor traffic through the dashboard

---

## 🛠️ Manual Installation (Alternative)

If you prefer manual installation or want to contribute to development:

### 1. Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nexoral/NexoralDNS.git
cd NexoralDNS
```

### 2. Start with Docker Compose
```bash
cd Scripts
sudo docker compose up -d
```

### Requirements
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Sudo/Administrator privileges
- Network access to configure router DNS settings

---

## 🌐 Post-Installation Setup

1. **Access Web Interface:** Open `http://localhost:4000`
2. **Login:** Username: `admin`, Password: `admin`
3. **Change Password:** Update default credentials immediately
4. **Activate Service:** Enter your activation key from the cloud platform
5. **Configure Router:** Set DNS server to your machine's IP address
6. **Set Static IP:** Reserve IP address in router to prevent DNS interruption

7. **Create custom domains & blocking rules:**

- Use the web interface to create custom internal domains (for example `myapp.ankan`) that resolve only within your LAN.
- Create blocking rules to block specific domains either for individual IP addresses or for the entire network. This is useful for parental controls, IoT protection, or blocking malicious domains.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**DNS not working after installation:**
- Ensure your router's DNS is set to the NexoralDNS machine IP
- Check if the Docker containers are running: `sudo docker compose ps`
- Verify port 53 is not blocked by firewall

**Web interface not accessible:**
- Check if port 4000 is open
- Restart services: `sudo docker compose restart`

**Version updates not working:**
- Ensure internet connectivity
- Check Docker image permissions

**If updates fail or network requests are blocked:**

- If the `update` command fails to fetch new images or the network is restricted, you can remove and reinstall the service as a recovery path:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nexoral/NexoralDNS/main/Scripts/install.sh | sudo bash -s remove
```

- If removal also fails due to network/DNS problems, re-enable the system resolver and restart it to restore system DNS resolution before retrying:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable systemd-resolved
sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved
```

- If you still need to manually restore local name resolution, edit `/etc/resolv.conf` and set the nameserver to the local stub resolver:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf
# set or ensure the file contains:
nameserver 127.0.0.53
```

### Complete Uninstallation

If you need to completely remove NexoralDNS from your system:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nexoral/NexoralDNS/main/Scripts/install.sh | sudo bash -s remove
```

This will:
- Stop all NexoralDNS services
- Remove Docker containers and images
- Delete all configuration files and data
- Clean up the installation directory

> ⚠️ **Warning:** This action is irreversible and will delete all your custom DNS configurations.
